### Exercise 2.1
> What are the differences between int, long, long long,
and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and
a double?

`int`:16bits but usually 32bits now
`long`:32bits 7 mantissa
`long long`:64bits
`short`:16bits

`unsigned` and `signed` type: a signed type represents negative or positive numbers, unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero.

`float` vs `double`:double has 2x precision of float. In general a double has 15 decimal digits of precision, while float has 7.
